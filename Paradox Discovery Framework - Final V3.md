## Sample V0 Section Transformation

### ❌ OLD Style (Too Technical)
```javascript
// Document Service Implementation
export class DocumentService {
    async createDocument(data, file, userId, orgId) {
        const client = await pool.connect();
        try {
            await client.query('BEGIN');
            // ... implementation code
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ NEW Style (UI-Focused)
```markdown
### Document Upload
**Upload Button:** Primary blue button in top-right corner
**Click Action:** Opens multi-step modal wizard
**Wizard Steps:**
1. Drag-drop zone with file type validation badges
2. Metadata form with title, category dropdown, tags input
3. Workflow selector with visual workflow preview
4. Success screen with confetti animation

**Mock Behavior:**
- Drag file → shows upload progress bar (2 seconds)
- Form validation → shows inline errors
- Submit → success toast "Document uploaded successfully"
- Modal closes → new document appears in grid
```

## Converting Existing Paradox Documents to V0

### Step 1: Extract User Journeys
From your Phase 3 user journey documentation, identify:
- Key screens users visit
- Actions they perform
- Feedback they need

### Step 2: Map to Views
Convert each major step to a view specification:
- Journey step → View name
- User action → Button/interaction
- System response → Mock feedback

### Step 3: Simplify Data Model
From your complex data model, extract only:
- Fields shown in the UI
- Status/badge values
- Relationships visible to users

### Step 4: Define Mock Behaviors
For each feature, specify:
- What triggers it (click, submit, drag)
- What feedback appears (toast, modal, animation)
- How long it takes (instant, 1s delay, etc.)

### Step 5: Write Natural Language Prompt
- Describe the interface, not the implementation
- Focus on what users see and do
- Make it exciting and visual

---

## Example Transformation

### Original Paradox Output (Technical):
"The system shall validate document metadata against business rules BR-001 through BR-005, storing validated data in PostgreSQL with foreign key constraints to the workflow table."

### V0 Prompt Version (Visual):
"When users click 'Next' in the upload wizard, the form shows inline validation with red error text for missing required fields. Fields turn green with checkmarks when valid. The 'Submit' button enables only when all validations pass."

---

## Conclusion

The V0 prototyping phase should produce a **visual demonstration** of your solution, not a technical implementation. By following this updated methodology:

1. **Stakeholders** can see and interact with the solution immediately
2. **Users** can validate workflows without waiting for development
3. **Developers** have clear UI specifications to implement
4. **Designers** understand the interaction patterns needed
5. **Product** can iterate quickly based on feedback

Remember: **V0 is about showing what's possible, not building what's possible.**
